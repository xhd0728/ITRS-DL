# ITRS-DL: An Image and Text Retrieval System based on Deep Learning

This project is acting as a graduation design of Harbin Engineering University.

## Project Overview

This project is the implementation of a graduation design focused on developing an image-text retrieval system based on deep learning. In the current context of flourishing information technology, intelligent information processing and artificial intelligence have become hot topics in research fields such as computer science and information processing. The goal of this project is to establish an efficient and accurate image-text retrieval system by integrating image and text processing technologies. Users can input either images or text for queries, and the system will match and return relevant results based on features extracted by deep learning models.

## Project Objectives

- Establish image and text datasets: including data collection, preprocessing, and label establishment.
- Implement image-text data feature extraction functionality: using deep learning models to effectively extract features from images and text.
- Implement image-text retrieval functionality: users can perform accurate information retrieval by inputting images or text.
- Implement visualization functionality for image-text retrieval: enhance user experience by visualizing system results.
